5 stage pipelined risc cpu

## Introduction
A 32-bit RISC CPU design provides higher performance capable of executing the arithmetic and logical instructions based on the strategy of reduced instructions set computer.

## Stages in Pipeline

- [Instruction fetch](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/risc_cpu/blob/main/README.md#instruction%20fetch)
- [Instruction decode](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/risc_cpu/blob/main/README.md#instruction%20decode)
- [Execution](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/risc_cpu/blob/main/README.md#execution)
- [Memory](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/risc_cpu/blob/main/README.md#instruction%20fetch)
